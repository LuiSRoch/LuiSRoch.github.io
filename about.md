I'm Luis Rocha, a financial profressional since 2012, but extracting, compiling and analyzing data since 2007.
I became a business intelligence analyst by taking my quantitative and management science skills (I hold two
Bachelor Degrees and have additional training in applied economics) and retooling them; teaching myself additional
coding in Excel VBA, SQL, Python, and re-visiting advanced statistics that are required to be a great analyst.

As an economist by traiding, I realized that one of the aspects for transmitting insightful information has to do
more with attidue and interest than skill and background. The desire to contribute to data-driven decision-making
gave me aspiration to self-learn, and thus the opportunity to work in supply chain, education and banking connecting 
subject matter expert's ideas to the improvement of data visualization and governance. In the course of that work, 
I developed dashboards and tables displaying inventory levels, product shortages, AML/KYC information as well as
sentivities and PnL data broken by portfolio.

The common denomimator binding my experience is that I work with business units and leverage software tools to
streamline processes. In 2018 I moved from New York to Paris where i'm exploring the labor market while continuing
to engage with programmers, data scientists, database administrators and machine learning experts in search of
innovative approaches to data mining and visualization.
