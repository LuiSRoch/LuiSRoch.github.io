I'm Luis Rocha, a financial professional since 2012, but extracting, compiling and analyzing data since 2007.
I became a business intelligence analyst by taking my quantitative and management science skills and retooling 
them; teaching myself additional coding in Excel VBA, SQL, Python, and re-visiting advanced statistics to manage 
and quantify large amounts of data.

As an economist by training, I realized that one of the aspects for transmitting insightful information has to do
more with attitude and interest than skill and background. The desire to contribute to data-driven decision-making
gave me aspiration to self-learn, and thus the opportunity to work in supply chain, edu
cation and banking connecting subject matter expert's ideas to the improvement of data visualization
and governance. In the course of that work, I developed dashboards and tables displaying inventory levels, 
product shortages, AML/KYC information as well as sensitivities and PnL data broken by portfolio.

The common denominator binding my experience is that I work with business units and leverage soft-
ware tools to streamline processes. In 2018 I moved from New York to Paris where I'm exploring the labor
market while continuing to engage with programmers, data scientists, database administrators and 
machine learning experts in search of innovative approaches to data mining and visualization.
