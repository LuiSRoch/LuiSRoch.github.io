I'm Luis Rocha, a financial professional since 2012, but extracting and analyzing data since 2007.
I became a business intelligence analyst by taking my quantitative and analytical skills and retooling 
them; learning to code in Excel VBA, SQL, Python, and studying advanced statistics to manage 
and quantify large amounts of data.

As an economist by training, I realized that one of the aspects of transmitting insightful information has to do
more with attitude and interest than skill and background. The desire to contribute to data-driven decision-making
gave me aspiration to learn, and thus the opportunity to have various responsibilites connecting subject matter expert's ideas 
to the improvement of data governance. In the course of that work, I developed dashboards and tables displaying 
inventory levels, AML/KYC transaction information, data loss as well as market risk and PnL information. The common 
denominator binding my experience is that I work with business units and leverage data-science
techniques to streamline visualizations.

In 2018 I moved from New York to Paris where I'm exploring the labor market in search of opportunities while continuing 
to engage with programmers, data scientists, database administrators and machine learning experts in search of innovative 
approaches to data mining and visualization.
